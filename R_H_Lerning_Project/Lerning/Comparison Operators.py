# Comparison Operators (Learning)
# ^^ we use Logical Operators in situations where we want to compare
#    want to compare variable with a value.
# >> exercise for the example:
#       >  if temperature is greater than 30,
#              it's a hot day
#          otherwise if it's less than 10
#              it's a cold day
#          otherwise
#              it's neither hot nor cold
tempeture = 30

if tempeture > 30:
    print("It's a hot day")
elif tempeture < 10:
    print("It's a cold day")
else:
    print("it's neither hot nor cold")

# boolean expression (Ture, False)
tempeture > 10 # Bigger than
tempeture < 10 # Less than
tempeture >= 30 # Bigger than or equal to
tempeture <= 30 # Less than or equal to
tempeture == 10 # equal to
tempeture != 10 # not equal to
